# [JS-CMP](https://github.com/JS-CMP)

Welcome to JS-CMP! Our mission is to bridge the gap between JavaScript and C++ by providing tools that bring the power and performance of C++ to JavaScript developers, specifically for backend applications. Our main project, the JS-CMP Transpiler, transforms JavaScript code into C++ and compiles it into high-performance executables. With our tools, JavaScript developers can take advantage of C++'s speed and efficiency without leaving the language they know.
